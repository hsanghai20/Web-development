package.json file have all the information regarding the author annd
all who contributes in the app
eg : it can also be called as the ingredients required to run our app


express is a framework and it is most trending bcz it is light weight dependencies
so we can fill our logic in many places to clearly make our app run as we want

difference btw framework and library is 
in library we can use it for any function we want we have full access to what we want we can use
but in framework some things are predefined and we dont have any control on that ..
